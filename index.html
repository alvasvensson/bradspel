            <p>Player 1 starts with putting down their colour. If the player has another brick of their colour
                horizontally, vertically or diagonally the bricks in between will turn into player 1's colour. When
                player 1 has put down their brick it's player 2's turn. The game ends when the board is full and the
                player with the most bricks of their colour on the board wins the game.
